Create empty Git repo in speciﬁed directory. Run with no arguments to initialize the current directory as a git repository. Clone repo located at <repo> onto local machine.  Original repo can be located on the local ﬁlesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH. Deﬁne author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs commonly use --global ﬂag to set conﬁg options for current user. Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit. Replace <directory> with a <ﬁle> to change a speciﬁc ﬁle. Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use <message> as the commit message.
List which ﬁles are staged, unstaged, and untracked.
Display the entire commit history using the default format. For customization see additional options. Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory
